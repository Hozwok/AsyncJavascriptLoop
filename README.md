AsyncJavascriptLoop
===================

A simple solution to perform recursive asynchronous calls and loops javascript turned into a simple to use jquery plugin.

This can be used with everything, because will be the user to supply a valid function to execute, so there is no limit in how many asynchronous situation this can be used.

I've not tried, owever, if it goes in a Stack Overflow Exception with too many data (not with Chrome, I hope)..

Feel free to modify as you need ;)
